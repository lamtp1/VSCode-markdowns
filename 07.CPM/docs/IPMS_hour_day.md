`Ask:` I have table name 'food_hour' contain 3 columns: name, value and time - type datetime (eg: 2023-04-21 14:00:00). Each name have multiple values, example 'meat'  values are: 1, 2, 3...100, each hour 'meat' has a value. How can I select the highest value of 'meat' in a day (in a total 24 values corresponding to 24 hours in a day) using python  and mysql.connector library and insert results to 'food_day' that have same columns with 'food_hour'. 

`Answers:`

To select the highest value of 'meat' in a day and insert the results into a new table named 'food_day' with the same columns as 'food_hour', you can use the GROUP BY, DATE() and MAX() functions in MySQL and the mysql.connector library in Python.

Here's an example Python script that connects to the MySQL database, executes the SQL query to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day, and inserts the results into the 'food_day' table:

        import mysql.connector

        # Connect to the database
        conn = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="yourusername",
        password="yourpassword",
        database="yourdatabase"
        )

        # Create a cursor object
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Execute the query to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day
        query = "SELECT name, MAX(value) as highest_value, DATE(time) as day FROM food_hour WHERE name='meat' GROUP BY name, day"
        cursor.execute(query)

        # Fetch the results
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Print the results
        for row in results:
            print(row)

        # Insert the results into the 'food_day' table
        insert_query = "INSERT INTO food_day (name, value, time) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
        for row in results:
            cursor.execute(insert_query, row)

        # Commit the changes to the database
        conn.commit()

        # Close the cursor and the database connection
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()

In this example, we're connecting to the MySQL database using mysql.connector.connect(), creating a cursor object, executing the SQL query to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day using cursor.execute(), fetching the results using cursor.fetchall(), printing the results using a loop, inserting the results into the 'food_day' table using a loop and cursor.execute(), committing the changes to the database using conn.commit(), and closing the cursor and the database connection using cursor.close() and conn.close().

Assuming the 'food_day' table has the same columns as the 'food_hour' table, the output of this script will be the same as the results of the SQL query used to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day, and the results will be inserted into the 'food_day' table.

`Ask`: the same  as previous question but i want to insert and update if duplicate

`Answer:`

To insert the results into the 'food_day' table and update if a duplicate is found, you can use the INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statement in MySQL and modify the Python script accordingly.

Here's an example Python script that connects to the MySQL database, executes the SQL query to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day, and inserts the results into the 'food_day' table, updating the values if a duplicate is found:

        import mysql.connector

        # Connect to the database
        conn = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="192.168.209.144",
        user="root",
        password="160299",
        database="cpm",
        port=3306
        )

        # Create a cursor object
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Execute the query to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day
        query = "SELECT food_name, MAX(food_value) AS GTLN, food_time, food_id FROM food_hour fh WHERE DATE(fh.food_time) = CURDATE()+1 GROUP BY food_name"
        cursor.execute(query)

        # Fetch the results
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Print the results
        for row in results:
        print(row)

        # Insert the results into the 'food_day' table
        insert_query = "INSERT INTO food_day (name, value, time, id) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)"
        for row in results:
        cursor.execute(insert_query, row)

        # Commit the changes to the database
        conn.commit()

        # Close the cursor and the database connection
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()

In this example, we're connecting to the MySQL database, creating a cursor object, executing the SQL query to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day, fetching the results, inserting the results into the 'food_day' table using INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, updating the values if a duplicate is found, committing the changes to the database, and closing the cursor and the database connection.

Assuming the 'food_day' table has the same columns as the 'food_hour' table, the output of this script will be the same as the results of the SQL query used to calculate the highest value of 'meat' for each day, and the results will be inserted into the 'food_day' table, updating the values if a duplicate is found.
