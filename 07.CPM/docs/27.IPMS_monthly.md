To select data from every day of the previous month in SQL, you can use the BETWEEN operator with appropriate date ranges. Here's an example using MySQL syntax:

        SELECT *
        FROM your_table
        WHERE date_column >= DATE_SUB(DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%Y-%m-01'), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
        AND date_column < DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%Y-%m-01')

To select data from every day of the previous month in SQL, you can use the BETWEEN operator with appropriate date ranges. Here's an example using MySQL syntax:


In this example, `your_table` is the name of your table, and `date_column` is the column that contains the date values.

The `DATE_SUB()` function subtracts one month from the first day of the current month `(DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%Y-%m-01'))`. This gives you the first day of the previous month. The `DATE_FORMAT()` function is used to format the current date to the `YYYY-MM-01` format.

The `WHERE` clause filters the rows based on the date range. It selects rows where the `date_column` is greater than or equal to the first day of the previous month and less than the first day of the current month.

Make sure to adjust the table name and column name according to your specific database schema.
