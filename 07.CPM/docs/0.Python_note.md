You can use the get() method of the dictionary in Python to avoid a KeyError. The get() method returns the value of the specified key if it exists in the dictionary, otherwise it returns a default value (which you can specify).

Here's an example of how you can use get() to avoid a KeyError when accessing a nested key in a JSON response:

        response = {'user': {'age': 25}}

        name = response['user'].get('name', 'nothing')
        print(name)  # prints 'nothing'

In this example, we are trying to access the value of the key 'name' which doesn't exist in the user dictionary. So, we pass 'nothing' as the default value to the get() method which returns this default value instead of raising a KeyError.
